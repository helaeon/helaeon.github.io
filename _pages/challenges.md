**4-30-25 Endurance Challenge pt 1**
------
Anything less than an hour is the sort of event that for most will require no support, no food, no water, no special consideration on equipment or course. Most people do not exercise, and most people that do, work for an hour or less at a time. Two hours is something else, four even more so. People are generally not used to being on their feet and under load continuously for these kinds of times. It's why Iron Man, Ultras, Marathons, and Spartan Beasts are a big deal even just to finish.

First challenge in this series is a 2 hour continuous mid-effort ideally on trail, with significant ascent (1000'+, 1500'+ is better). No rest, no stopping unless you're quitting. Most people when they go on a hike spend a lot of time in zone 1, and some spikes of 4 when they climb hills. For this the goal is to even that out a bit, on the easy stuff it's still high 2 - mid 3. And allowing into high 4 for the hills, we're trying to stay out of zone 5 like usual (though it will happen if you're doing this right and the hills are severe enough).

You have to decide your paces and need for support, the more you know about yourself the more even your pace can be and wiser about hills. You will likely want no less than 2L of water, unless you are experienced at these times. 2.5L might be wise to make sure you don't run out. 2 L bladder and a 500mL flask is handy, especially if the flask is electrolyte mix. Be thinking about 20-25g of sugar every 30-60 minutes after the first hour, though some will want to start the snacks about 30 min in, and put in 100 cal or so every 30 min thereafter or 50 every 15 minutes. For this challenge that would be 2-3 packs of gummy bears total. Don't forget about electrolytes we all have different needs (genetics) here so it's hard to prescribe and heat matters a ton. Gatorade probably isn't right, it's too sweet and not enough salt. It's awesome for after. I've been using products from SaltStik (chewable tabs), Gnarly, Skratch, LiquidIV, and LMNT. Not enough is usually a bigger problem than too much, if you're healthy. Potassium in particular.

**3-27-25 40 Minute Steady State**
------
On your favorite conditioning implement maintain the same pace or wattage for 40 minutes straight, no breaks. Must be zone 2 or higher heart rate. Ideally it will be zone 2 and you'll sit there the whole time.

Where did the cardiac climb start? How long was it massively too easy? Did you blow up at the end?

******

**2-25-25 Ascending Doubles - Bench**
------
You'll need a barbell, plates, and a power rack or squat/bench stand with the safeties set appropriately. Safeties set appropriately is not optional!

Each rep must touch your chest to count, butt stays on bench, and bar under control. No sternum trampolines.

Start with the bar. Each set will be a double. Jumps may be 20 lb, 10 lb, 5 lb, or 2.5 lb. Ascent ends when you fail on depth, or decide you cannot continue with good form. You may rest between doubles as much as you like. Once you switch to a lower increment you cannot go to a bigger jump again.

Score is your top weight successfully benched with good form & depth.
What was that number, and how many total reps did you end up doing?

**2-9-25 C2 Valentines**
------
[Concept2 Valentine Challenge 2025](https://log.concept2.com/challenges/valentine)
RowErg, SkiErg, or Bike(counts for half) 14,000m cumulative between Feb 9-14. If you use a C2 erg product you can log it with their apps to go on the honorboard.

If you want to do only the challenge and don't care about the leaderboards logging 14km of running counts as well.
******

**2-3-25 Consistency Challenge**
------
Consistency is the key to gains. Standardize before you optimize. Gear up and make it to your workout space three times this week (preferably to plan), even if you don't do anything. You can skip but you still have to go. Very probable that once you're there you will do something.

******

**1-27-25 Ascending Doubles - Squat**
------
You'll need a barbell, plates, and a power rack or squat stand with the safeties set appropriately. Or a belt squat setup.

Each squat must be below parallel to count (top of hip socket below top of knee). Ass to Grass is not necessary unless that is the standard you choose for your squats. You may do the squat variation of your choice, however, once you choose you must stick with it for the challenge and depth standard does not change.

Start at one-half body weight and do a double. Add 10 lb (or 5kg) and do another double, repeat until you put it in the safeties, fail on depth, or decide you cannot continue with good form. You may rest between doubles as much as you like. When getting to the very top end you may switch to 5 lb (2.5kg) increments, once you do you may not go back to 10 lb (5kg).

Score is your top weight successfully squatted with good form & depth.
What was that number, and how many total reps did you end up doing?

**1-22-25 Sandbag to Shoulder**
------
Simple but not easy. Biggest sandbag to shoulder you can muster AND be able to walk with it. Bonus points for taking it up a flight of stairs.

******

**1-07-25 Fast Steady State**
------
This is a 2 week challenge as you'll need two of your "long run" days to do it. You'll need knowledge of your heart rate zones for this to work properly.

Week one you Run/Bike/Row at your fastest comfortable pace, but you may not breach zone 4. If you get there you have to slow down, or stop (if you stop start again when you're at the bottom of zone 2). Clock keeps running when you stop. Keep this up for an hour. You'll notice that your pace is very uneven and overall you'll be slowing down during your active phases. It's very likely your speed will be entirely controlled by bumping into zone 4 and how long it takes to rest back to the bottom of zone 2. When you're finished you need to record your average power or pace for the entire hour (including the rests).

Week two you use the same implement as last week, but this time set out at the average pace yielded from last week. Very likely this will be close to your average steady state pace, and this segment will prove out if that's so. Hold that pace/power for the entire time. At the beginning it is likely to be too easy, end maybe a little too hard. You still should probably not breach zone 4 (but if you do it's okay, especially at the end).

**12-30-24 Should you be a Resolutioner?**
------
Are you actually as strong, fast, endurant as you think you are? 

When was the last time you weighed yourself?

Squat, Deadlift, Bench, Overhead, Chin-up for weight, not reps.

500m run for time (or row, or 1KM on bike)

1hr steady state run, row, or bike.

Is it what you expected?

**11-12-2024 Running Challenge Test**
------
It's time to test if you actually brought down your high to max effort run time for the distance you chose. Can you cover 1.5 miles in 11 minutes or less? Or if you did the 5k version did that get faster? It's time for a new PR.

******

**11-05-2024 Rack-Ceiling Height Rope Progression**
------
Finding a full height (20'+) rope to climb is really difficult. Training and practicing to be able to climb such a rope can be done with a ceiling height or power rack height rope using your secure pull up bar. All ropes are not created equal, the natural fiber thick ropes with deep groove braiding and a big diameter (but not too big) are much easier to climb than a poly ship rope or a poly rope generally like would be seen at Spartan. A belay climbing rope is incredibly hard to climb due to its slickness and narrow diameter.

The higher the rope can be hung the more productive your training will be, but on the pullup bar of an 84" power rack is good enough. Make sure the rope will not slide side to side.

**Footlock from a box** Sit on a box, chair, etc, with the rope hanging in front of you. Practice several different kinds of foot locks and try to push the rope away from you with your feet once locked in. Then stand up from the box to your pull-up bar to do a foot assisted pull-up. You can use your hands on the rope to stabilize on the way up, but your footlock must remain solid.

**Footlock from hang** Hanging from your pull up bar, establish your footlock then do an assisted pull-up by standing up on the rope.

**Plank-ups** Lay on your back with the rope hanging such that it dangles down to hit you about at the belly button. Grab the rope and climb it with only your hands keeping your body rigid and rotating up on your heels. Then walk yourself back down. If you're not strong enough to go hand over hand, do a single pull up on the rope while planked then let yourself down. 

**Genie** See the earlier challenge on this one. This will convert the hand conditioning and row type pull from the plank ups to a more vertical grip overhead power application that is needed to rope climb.

**Putting it all together** With a rack height rope you should be able to practice the take-off from the ground. Unfortunately converting that to the next climb will have to be done at your event or when you do have access to a full length rope. But, if you can do the above your chances are good that you'll get it. 

Here are two videos for some technique & instruction. This is one of the places that the CrossFitters have a lot of positive things to teach. These are both pretty long.

**10-21-2024 Concept2 Skeleton Crew**
------
[Concept2 Skeleton Crew Challenge 2024](https://log.concept2.com/challenges/skeleton-crew)

RowErg, SkiErg, or Bike(2x meters) 31,000m cumulative between October 25-31. If you use a C2 erg product you can log it with their apps to go on the honorboard. Comes out to about 4,500 m/day if you go every day 5,200 if you do 6 of the 7 days. 

If you do the 5200m it'll be 20 to 30 min each day. Similar effort to running a 5k, but it doesn't beat you up nearly as bad.

If you want to do only the challenge and don't care about the leaderboards logging 31km of running applies as well.

**10-14-2024 Grip Dyno**
------
Objective, independent measurement of grip strength using a dynamometer. These are available fairly inexpensively from Amazon and will work sufficiently well. They're about $20-30.

Level 1: Less than 100 lb

Level 2: 125 lb

Level 3: 150 lb

Level 4: 175 lb

Level 5: 200 lb +

For reference many of the Ninja Warrior guys are level 3-4, strongmen will be level 5, most women will not break level 1. Average dude will be level 1-2.

******

**10-7-2024 Overhead Plate Walk**
------
Hold a 45 pound bumper plate overhead and walk as far as you can. Plate must remain above the level of your head, it may not rest on your head. Your total distance is from where you lock it out overhead to where any part of the plate drops below the level of your head.

******

**9-30-2024 The Genie - Rope Climb** 
------
On a rope suitable for rope climbing, sit with it hanging between your legs sitting criss cross and rise.

Level 1: Reach up and do a single pull up.

Level 2: Pull yourself up maintaining the criss cross legs.

Level 3: Pull yourself up and keep climbing without using your legs.

Level 4: Pull yourself up and keep climbing while maintaining the criss cross.

Level 5: Pull yourself up, keep climbing, maintaining the criss cross to the level that you can fully extend when you're done and your feet are above the floor.

**9-23-2024 Spray Bottle Challenge**  
------
Get as much volume of fluid out of the sprayer as possible in 1 minute. You may not switch hands before the minute is up or support the bottle on anything (including yourself).
Modification of the first challenge in this video:

**9-10-2024 Police 1.5 Mile Improvement**
------
1 easy (zone 2-3), 1 fast (zone 4), 1 long run (over an hour) every week for the next 10 weeks. Goal is to do 1.5 miles in less than 13 minutes (sub 8:40/mi pace sustained). Or, improve your 1.5 or 5k pace overall if you're already that fast. Bonus if you can do sub 13 min on the spot without zone 5. As in, not specifically tapering or resting for the test event.
