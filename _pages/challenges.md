**9-10-2024 Police 1.5 Mile Improvement**
------
1 easy (zone 2-3), 1 fast (zone 4), 1 long run (over an hour) every week for the next 10 weeks. Goal is to do 1.5 miles in less than 13 minutes (sub 8:40/mi pace sustained). Or, improve your 1.5 or 5k pace overall if you're already that fast. Bonus if you can do sub 13 min on the spot without zone 5. As in, not specifically tapering or resting for the test event.

**10-21-2024 Concept2 Skeleton Crew**
------
[Concept2 Skeleton Crew Challenge 2024](https://log.concept2.com/challenges/skeleton-crew)

RowErg, SkiErg, or Bike(2x meters) 31,000m cumulative between October 25-31. If you use a C2 erg product you can log it with their apps to go on the honorboard. Comes out to about 4,500 m/day if you go every day 5,200 if you do 6 of the 7 days. 

If you do the 5200m it'll be 20 to 30 min each day. Similar effort to running a 5k, but it doesn't beat you up nearly as bad.

If you want to do only the challenge and don't care about the leaderboards logging 31km of running applies as well.
