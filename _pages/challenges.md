**12-30-24 Should you be a Resolutioner?**
------
Are you actually as strong, fast, endurant as you think you are? 

When was the last time you weighed yourself?

Squat, Deadlift, Bench, Overhead, Chin-up for weight, not reps.

500m run for time (or row, or 1KM on bike)

1hr steady state run, row, or bike.

Is it what you expected?

**11-12-2024 Running Challenge Test**
------
It's time to test if you actually brought down your high to max effort run time for the distance you chose. Can you cover 1.5 miles in 11 minutes or less? Or if you did the 5k version did that get faster? It's time for a new PR.

**11-05-2024 Rack-Ceiling Height Rope Progression**
------
Finding a full height (20'+) rope to climb is really difficult. Training and practicing to be able to climb such a rope can be done with a ceiling height or power rack height rope using your secure pull up bar. All ropes are not created equal, the natural fiber thick ropes with deep groove braiding and a big diameter (but not too big) are much easier to climb than a poly ship rope or a poly rope generally like would be seen at Spartan. A belay climbing rope is incredibly hard to climb due to its slickness and narrow diameter.

The higher the rope can be hung the more productive your training will be, but on the pullup bar of an 84" power rack is good enough. Make sure the rope will not slide side to side.

**Footlock from a box** Sit on a box, chair, etc, with the rope hanging in front of you. Practice several different kinds of foot locks and try to push the rope away from you with your feet once locked in. Then stand up from the box to your pull-up bar to do a foot assisted pull-up. You can use your hands on the rope to stabilize on the way up, but your footlock must remain solid.

**Footlock from hang** Hanging from your pull up bar, establish your footlock then do an assisted pull-up by standing up on the rope.

**Plank-ups** Lay on your back with the rope hanging such that it dangles down to hit you about at the belly button. Grab the rope and climb it with only your hands keeping your body rigid and rotating up on your heels. Then walk yourself back down. If you're not strong enough to go hand over hand, do a single pull up on the rope while planked then let yourself down. 

**Genie** See the earlier challenge on this one. This will convert the hand conditioning and row type pull from the plank ups to a more vertical grip overhead power application that is needed to rope climb.

**Putting it all together** With a rack height rope you should be able to practice the take-off from the ground. Unfortunately converting that to the next climb will have to be done at your event or when you do have access to a full length rope. But, if you can do the above your chances are good that you'll get it. 

Here are two videos for some technique & instruction. This is one of the places that the CrossFitters have a lot of positive things to teach. These are both pretty long.

**10-21-2024 Concept2 Skeleton Crew**
------
[Concept2 Skeleton Crew Challenge 2024](https://log.concept2.com/challenges/skeleton-crew)

RowErg, SkiErg, or Bike(2x meters) 31,000m cumulative between October 25-31. If you use a C2 erg product you can log it with their apps to go on the honorboard. Comes out to about 4,500 m/day if you go every day 5,200 if you do 6 of the 7 days. 

If you do the 5200m it'll be 20 to 30 min each day. Similar effort to running a 5k, but it doesn't beat you up nearly as bad.

If you want to do only the challenge and don't care about the leaderboards logging 31km of running applies as well.

**10-14-2024 Grip Dyno**
------
Objective, independent measurement of grip strength using a dynamometer. These are available fairly inexpensively from Amazon and will work sufficiently well. They're about $20-30.

Level 1: Less than 100 lb

Level 2: 125 lb

Level 3: 150 lb

Level 4: 175 lb

Level 5: 200 lb +

For reference many of the Ninja Warrior guys are level 3-4, strongmen will be level 5, most women will not break level 1. Average dude will be level 1-2.

**10-7-2024 Overhead Plate Walk**
------
Hold a 45 pound bumper plate overhead and walk as far as you can. Plate must remain above the level of your head, it may not rest on your head. Your total distance is from where you lock it out overhead to where any part of the plate drops below the level of your head.

**9-10-2024 Police 1.5 Mile Improvement**
------
1 easy (zone 2-3), 1 fast (zone 4), 1 long run (over an hour) every week for the next 10 weeks. Goal is to do 1.5 miles in less than 13 minutes (sub 8:40/mi pace sustained). Or, improve your 1.5 or 5k pace overall if you're already that fast. Bonus if you can do sub 13 min on the spot without zone 5. As in, not specifically tapering or resting for the test event.
