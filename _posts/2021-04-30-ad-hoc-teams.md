This one is a bit different because I'm thinking out loud here and asking a bunch of questions. Y'all know how to contact me semi-directly via MPG and Greyman if you have answers or thoughts.

Having friends to help you in a critical encounter is extremely beneficial. But, most of us cannot take our backup everywhere nor regularly and intensively train with everyone that may aid us in a critical incident. Operating as an overt team with uniforms and specific memberships and rosters makes one a target for other factions that do something similar. Most of us cannot and do not want to live our lives that way anyway.

Below I use the term "critical incident". In which I mean one that time is an issue, one or more people may already be involved in resolving it. Either by dispensing medical techniques, freedom seeds, corralling the 80%, or any other number of activities trying to make things better or at least not worse. In a critical incident it is not practical to conduct interviews of those coming to attempt to help.

- How do we interface with people we've never met that are of a similar mentality and morality during a critical incident?

- How is this accomplished if they do not follow the same groups, shows, channels, etc that we do?

- How do we identify ourselves to them without violating greyman concepts generally? What kind of identification or signals will we accept in return?
Consider in Montana there are a million people. At least half are friendlies if lead (500k); a fifth of that useful (100k); there are maybe 6 of those on Greyman, maybe a dozen on MPG... in the fourth largest of the States. Some kind of transmitted secret hand-shake or code word isn't going to work.

- How do we best engage their help or help them? Who "runs" the situation?

- How do we best identify ourselves as friendlies to first responders when they arrive?

- How is the situation concluded or extracted from if first responders do not arrive or make the situation worse?

Some of my thinking comes from policing and being able to interface with officers I've never met from jurisdictions far afield, with different training and different policies. Generally that officer is in uniform arriving in a marked vehicle so there's some symbolism there that we can't take advantage of. There are cases of plain clothes officers from out of jurisdiction having to intervene in a high crime or active shooter situation, and they seem to interface quite nicely generally. 

- Is it a demonstration of competency with the situation? Being aware of what's going on and arrival of first responders? Actually heeding "Uniform Wins" friend-or-foe rules? 

- Is it that the departments responding to those situations are pro citizen and citizen response to these kinds of situations?

- What lessons can we learn from incidents that have already happened tip things more in our favor in this regard, recognizing it never will be perfect and never can be?

Overall here we have an issue of trust. Understandably trust but verify grows more and more difficult to actually practice. Seems the shields should be up with anyone we encounter. There are far too many bad actors in our midst. Far too many posers. Too many idiots that are "on our side", but know nothing and simply want to throw weight around to have an appearance of being a "good person" but did nothing to prepare. Their involvement is for their ego and/or the 'gram not to actually help. Definitely too many armchair commando blow hards that feel suited for command though they've done nothing and know nothing (I'm not one of these, I promise). People that are willing to smite and spite when they don't get their way. Frankly we have a bunch of children in adult bodies running around. 

I remember being on calls and wanting to try and resolve it before un-requested backup arrived because there was a good probability they would make things worse and more complicated.

- How do we make sure we don't make things worse when we're the second responder and wish to assist?

- What can we do to make it so our help is actually welcome because it is unlikely we will make things worse or need babysitting?
This is a key piece to getting police to return to a pro-citizen stance by the way.
