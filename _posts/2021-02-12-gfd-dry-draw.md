Everyone should spend quite a bit of time on dry fire as it is one of the best things you can do to clean up trigger pull and grip. Something a lot of people fail to do is do a frequent gear check doing a full draw from concealment. Just like dry fire this can be done off the range. At the range people tend to set up perfect situations, move concealment garments out of the way prior to drawing, and/or run with a range rig and never practicing with their concealment rig. Keep in mind that drawing and re-holstering is generally the activity responsible for someone shooting themselves via sloppy trigger discipline.

Describing how to do a clean draw and presentation is difficult to do in writing. This is one of those places that a video is going to win.

There are several levels of draw practice from fully dry to loaded (wet). During your off range draw practice you will always do several things. 
1) Aim small, miss small - Focus and lock onto a small target that is part of a larger one and put your sights exactly on that point during presentation.
2) Full presentation from concealment grip to sights. Clean, fast, and minimize clean up on sights and adjustments to grip.
3) Practice extreme trigger discipline. Finger stays off the trigger until the decision to shoot has been made. This will help you build that discipline in every day use. Do not get overly excited and torch off a round. There is no such thing as accidental discharges, they are all negligent.
4) As danger level increases maximum draw speed reduces.

#####Note there is a danger level here. You are responsible for your own safety, the safety of those around you, and any negligent discharges are on you. This is a violent and dangerous martial art filled with calculated risks. Your discipline and perfectionism is key to success in this art. You cannot be absent minded or lackadaisical in your training, practice, or execution. That all said, I will not treat you as a child and seek to mitigate any risk or make impossible any problem. Follow the 4 Rules, focus, and you'll be fine.

**Fully dry** is the primary way to practice draw from concealment and proof that your holster is not a problem. Have your gun completely unloaded while performing your dry draws but firing mechanism charged. At no point should your firing mechanism engage. If the gun goes click something is wrong with your setup. It cannot be trusted for carry until that problem is diagnosed and resolved. Re-holsters are practiced as they would be in the field. Look down to check to see the "basket" is free of obstruction. If there is any resistance to re-holstering, stop, clear the obstruction, then continue. 

**Fully dry - Trigger Press** Fully dry draws may include a trigger pull once sights are aligned to reward for a good clean draw. If trigger pulls are desired when the decision to move to those are made, double check the gun is empty and all ammunition is off your person. I practice with the magazine out of the gun so I can feel the empty hole in the bottom of the weapon prior to every draw to make sure I am still unloaded. Do not put your fire decision on autopilot! Draw & Fire is an irresponsible standard operating procedure. It is sloppy as far as self defense shooting goes. Further it means you cannot safely and responsibly utilize any check or practice technique that involves the weapon being loaded except when you are on the range.

Practice your draw from non-perfect situations. Can you draw and present while seated? From your vehicle? Threats forward or to either side? If you regularly carry a pack or bag can you still draw? Can you draw cleanly with a jacket or coat on? Can you draw with your winter gloves (can you fire cleanly)?

#####DO NOT MOVE TO THE FOLLOWING UNTIL YOUR DRY DRAWS ARE OF HIGH DISCIPLINE. DO NOT CARRY YOUR WEAPON OR DO WET DRAWS UNTIL YOU CAN PERFORM DRY DRAWS WITHOUT INCIDENT (UNINTENTIONAL TRIGGER PULLS, DROPPED WEAPON, SUPPORT HAND IN FRONT OF WEAPON, SNAGS ON CLOTHING, ETC)

**Wet Draw - Load Weapon** Some people store their carry weapon unloaded and this is a good thing to do prior to loading. It gets a daily gear check in and a training rep on the draw. Do a single draw repetition from full concealment without a trigger pull as the weapon is assumed to be loaded. No decision to fire has been made so finger must stay along the frame. Lock the slide back, load a magazine, drop slide, re-holster weapon, eject magazine while the gun is holstered, plus 1 to mag, re-seat magazine, test that it's seated, re-conceal. Do note that unloading and re-loading your weapon each day will lead to set-back in your carry ammunition requiring it be replaced much more often. It is also necessary to more often cycle the ammunition in your magazine so the same two rounds are not being chambered again and again.

**Wet Draw - Fully Loaded Weapon** Some people store their carry weapon in holster fully loaded. Same gear check can be performed as above but no need to load the weapon. Some will do a press-check to confirm the weapon is loaded after the draw stroke, prior to reholstering. Again it must be stressed. Most people shoot themselves on drawing and reholstering. Negligent discharges often occur when people are mindlessly handling their weapon, especially when presenting. I suggest NOT doing the wet draws at full speed. Deliberate, perfect, extreme discipline, high thought. This is also the slowest draw speed, the draw stroke must be perfect.

If you carry a red-dot sight it is wise to check your sight is functional prior to carrying the weapon. A wet draw is a way to do that and gets you a rep practicing your presentation.

Another good reason to do a daily wet draw is to confirm you can actually get your weapon out of the holster cleanly with what you are wearing. The gun is where you expect, your grip from concealment works, your clothing does not get in the way. Better to know when you don't need it and make adjustments, then fight through an unnecessary problem when you're about to die.
