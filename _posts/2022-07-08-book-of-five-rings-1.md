I'm writing this as I re-read the Book of Five Rings. The first time I read this book it was absolutely life changing. Musashi primed me for Jordan Peterson years later. Book of Five Rings made my interest and knowledge in the martial and destructive productive and okay. I think this is a work for the Novice about ready to become an Intermediate, and the Advanced to re-visit time to time. Truths of individual combat and the art of war shine through this work constantly and will apply no matter your discipline. It will read differently each time you approach it as wisdom that was beyond you is now apparent as other lessons have been integrated. My belief is the Book of Five Rings is unlike The Prince and the Art of War in that it is not very useful to the non-martial. The weak, the meek, the serf will not extract much wisdom from this work. It is for dangerous people.

**Introduction**
>"I have never had a teacher while studying the Ways of the various arts and accomplishments, or in anything at all"

Musashi was alive during the Kyoto Renaissance, influenced by many, but assembled his own methodologies and skills. He did not wholesale lift a whole school or ascribe his identity or his skills to masters he was influenced by or certifications. Musashi was not good at just swordfighting but many other disciplines some far removed from the martial arts. One might ponder this vs our current day where many will not even listen to a word you say without throwing out some certification, badge, or name dropping some school or teacher that is famous. Your job or title determines on which you are allowed to speak, and of which you may be considered skilled. Your demonstrated knowledge and ability meaning nothing. Ancient Japan was somewhat similar in this way. Musashi was something special. The way to being special is assembling yourself and standing up yourself on your own abilities not shortcutting using the fame and authority of others. It's not about assembling a resume, it's about being good at things, doing things, and as many different things as possible.

It must also be understood that Musashi was not, and did not see himself, specially skilled, strong, or fast. Musashi was intelligent, thoughtful, clever, disciplined, and unorthodox. He was not ashamed to do things that were abnormal but were very effective.

The biases, justifications, and rationalizations for Musashi's own life are embedded in the above. He wrote this a week before his death for his disciples to follow. If you want to be like Musashi, full Ronin focused entirely on being the best in the Martial Arts it would be necessary to forgo all else. With Musashi there is no balance. While a polymath he is fully focused on combat as the first pursuit in life and all things. I find the wisdom in the above is determining what you actually want and stripping those things that are in the way of that. For most this will be many things and thus necessary to bring them into harmony and eject those which are incompatible and conflicting. This is a good time to determine levels of importance, concern vs control, needs vs wants. Understand that you cannot have everything.

There's a theme of avoiding the useless and that which will cause hesitation and doubt. While I agree this often makes things easier, some of those things are the point of life for many, even those that follow the Way. Musashi was about being able to pick up and change path on a moment's notice so did not want to be burdened by people, things, and emotions that might act as resistance to his change. Certainly he never wants an anchor. He is Ronin: a masterless, mercenary, roaming Samurai. Thus, the Way of Walking Alone. In a way Musashi was a prototype man going his own way, but one that has been elevated to mythical and hero status. This should be considered, as well as how we regard MGTOW sorts today.

The Way of Walking Alone shows me how Musashi and I are different, with different goals, living in different times, in different cultures, with different priorities. The intersections though I find valuable, and those interpreted that I don't agree with wholly but do find conditional value.

*Do not turn your back on the various Ways of this world.* No knowledge should be beyond you, or unknowable. No skill desired or useful beneath you or not yours to know.

*Do not scheme for physical pleasure.* The scheming part is important. Avoiding degeneracy is important. So much corruption and deleterious behavior comes from those that are addicted to the pleasures of their bodies, rather than using their body as a tool to experience the world. They are ruled by their flesh and instincts, not their mind and rationality. Their emotions are not a sensor but a processor. They are animals to be trained.

*Do not intend to rely on anything.* Relying on things and people is inevitable. Intending to do so, no backup plan, no contingency is incredibly unwise and is a major source of disaster.

*Consider yourself lightly; consider the world deeply.* Departure from the Art of War here. I disagree with Musashi. You should know yourself well and ignore the silliness of the world, while still understanding greatly Natural Laws and the secrets of the universe. This, I believe, comes from Samurai culture and a belief that any individual is not important.

*Do not ever think in acquisitive terms.* From Buddhism. As a Ronin possessions would be unwieldy and binding. Maybe serve no purpose. For us... you solve your problems not some magical niche tool or the latest device. You are the weapon, not your gear. There's a little bit of a paradox here. Even thinking of acquiring skills leans towards attending classes and attaining certifications rather than actual learning.

*Do not regret things about your own personal life.* Musashi is the most correct here, and this is the one I have the hardest time with. Learning from your mistakes and not regretting the past are things that are difficult to do together, but must happen. Paths that could not be taken cannot be known, so should not be regretted as you'll always imagine those paths better than they'd actually have been. Many times, that path was blocked to you for a reason that potentially kept you from catastrophe.

*Do not envy another's good or evil.* Envy and jealousy are generally deleterious traits. Though envy can be motivating if deployed with good nature and wisdom.

*Do not lament parting on any road whatsoever.* A lot like not having regrets generally. You can't know how things would turn out, and it does no good to look back in hindsight as you cannot change anything about paths taken in the past, and events that occurred. Musashi often suggests looking at the present and forward, and refrain from looking rearward.

*Do not complain or feel bitterly about yourself or others.* Oof. Musashi talking to me again. Mostly the myself part. Though I wonder if Musashi would modify this in the modern day. Feudal Japan was different than the West in probably more ways than it was similar, and the Modern West is incredibly different from the time he lived, as is the population and how they behave.

*Have no heart for approaching the path of love.* Here's one where Musashi's priorities, and maybe regrets, show and he tries to justify and dismiss them. While a polymath, Musashi was singularly minded on being the best swordsman in Japan and recognized as such. Everything he did outside of the Martial Arts was a past time even though he did those things to a high level as his discipline demanded. Never would those past times be allowed to conflict with his Martial Art or it's pursuit, and better it should reinforce it.

*Do not have preferences.* & *While it's different with military equipment, do not be fond of material things.* These contradict, and again show Musashi's biases. Zen Buddhism again too. He's trying to disconnect from the material, remember they are just things, and not be so reliant on ***your*** things. If you run a Glock be able to run a Sig. AR, better be able to use an AK to a similar level. Carry your weapons in a variety of ways. Have it not matter.

*Do not harbor hopes for your own personal home.* & *Do not be intent on possessing valuables or a fief in old age.* Way of Walking Alone. Being a Ronin. Always wandering. Again, Musashi's life and what was necessary to be like him. Though, he did try to build his own home, and his own fief, it didn't go well. Something to be said about the singular focus on chasing wealth and power, how for most of us that will be our undoing and undermine getting it.

*Do not have a liking for delicious food for yourself.* & *Do not fast so that it affects you physically.* Food is fuel. It's chemistry. Though Musashi did not know this as we do today. Use food as an item that makes you stronger, helps you grow and recover. Living to eat rather than eating to live is unwise. Food is a means to an end, it should not be the end. Do not eat to the point that fasts are necessary, nor fast because you are too busy or engrossed in your affairs such that it weakens the meat-mech.

*Respect the gods and Buddhas, but do not depend on them.* Luck... Natural Law. Understand that perversions of Natural Law happen all the time and often for some period, though the bill always comes due. Do not rely on luck and good fortune to get you through. Sometimes everything won't be okay. Prepare, Plan, Persevere, Prosper. ***You*** do it. Interestingly doing that which is in accordance with Natural Law & the Laws of the Universe tends to prevent that bill coming due and is the most efficient and sure way to operate, though often not the most profitable short term.

*While on the Way, do not begrudge death.* & *Never depart from the Way of the Martial Arts.* The last time I read the Book of Five Rings was before 2020. I took this in a very martial literal way. That fear of death, assures it. Act each day as if it is how you will be remembered. You never depart from the Way, thus you deeply understand at all times the nature of life and death, maybe knowing it is a truth it is unnecessary to dwell on it. 2020 happened and I can add more. Fear of death causes irrational and perverse behavior, and is an incredibly effective measure to effect control; it completely depletes the mind of the person with that fear. We all die, at some point, and at some time; failing to live your life because of a fear of death you might as well be dead. You become a zombie.
