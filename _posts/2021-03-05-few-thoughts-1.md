Had a busy week so didn't have time to write anything properly. A couple of short thoughts for you.

> “Teaching people a large number of sword techniques is turning the way into a business of selling goods, making beginners believe that there is something profound in their training by impressing them with a variety of techniques. This attitude toward strategy must be avoided, because thinking that there is a variety of ways of cutting a man down is evidence of a disturbed mind. In the world, different ways of cutting a man down do not exist.” -Musashi; This applies to gunfighting. Think about it.

Humans are adaptive. It's natural law that big changes happen slowly over time. Best time to start is a little bit yesterday. Next best is a little bit today.

A good way to train is to figure out how you would defeat yourself, and how to counter that. Both as the attacker and as yourself.

If you haven't read the "Book of Five Rings" and thought about it extensively you're not serious.

Strength makes everything you do easier.

Make complicated things simple. Beware of someone who makes simple things complicated.
